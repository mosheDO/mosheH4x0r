## Reverse Me

**Name:** _Reverse Me_ <br>
**Description:** Don't complain if you can't see me, because I have to be reversed to make me run ðŸ™ƒ<br>
**Category:** Reverse

**Author: Simone Aonzo**

This is how the **Reverse Me** challenge was solved 
the that was included were called `img.jpg`
why image file in a reversing challenge but lets check.

if we tried to see the image windows viewer can't show this.

```zsh
âœ— strings img.jpg
...
atador.
inif.
txet.
ces.tlp.
tog.tlp.
tini.
tlp.aler.
nyd.aler.
5.2.2_CBILG
43.2_CBILG
4.2_CBILG
liaf_khc_kcats__
tixe
...
```

We can see some strings are related to elf files so checking with HexDump


```zsh
âœ— xxd img.jpg   
00003870: 0000 0000 0000 1310 0000 0001 003e 0003  .............>..
00003880: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 0102 464c 457f  ............FLE.
```

It seems an `elf` file that was reversed and now the description was clear  

So now we need to reverse the bytes:

`âœ— emit img.jpg | /home/ubuntu/.local/bin/rev | dump img.elf`

so we opened the file in IDA, and I was struggling to find the correct code on how to find what was the flag, but the function `sub_401460` was receiving argv from user

the `decrypt_me_flag` seems like it calculate and print the flag, so I wasn't sure so I tried to make the func `sub_401460` to return true by satisfying the 4 equation that we can see here:

In order to decrypt equations there is a tool by microsoft named z3:

```ipython
In [1]: from z3 import *
   ...:
   ...: # Define variables
   ...: arg_1, arg_2, arg_3, arg_4 = Ints('arg_1 arg_2 arg_3 arg_4')
   ...:
   ...: # Define the equations
   ...: eq1 = 3 * arg_4 + arg_3 + 4 * arg_2 - 10 * arg_1 == 28
   ...: eq2 = And(9 * arg_2 - 8 * arg_1 + 6 * arg_3 - 2 * arg_4 == 72, arg_4 - 3 * arg_2 - 2 * arg_1 - 8 * arg_3 == 29)
   ...: eq3 = arg_3 + 5 * arg_1 + 7 * arg_2 - 6 * arg_4 == 88
   ...:
   ...: # Create solver
   ...: solver = Solver()
   ...:
   ...: # Add equations to the solver
   ...: solver.add(eq1)
   ...: solver.add(eq2)
   ...: solver.add(eq3)
   ...:
   ...: # Check satisfiability and get the result
   ...: if solver.check() == sat:
   ...:     model = solver.model()
   ...:     print("arg_1 =", model[arg_1])
   ...:     print("arg_2 =", model[arg_2])
   ...:     print("arg_3 =", model[arg_3])
   ...:     print("arg_4 =", model[arg_4])
   ...: else:
   ...:     print("No solution exists.")
   ...:
arg_1 = -3
arg_2 = 8
arg_3 = -7
arg_4 = -9
```

and we got the results it was strange to see that some of the values were negative so I tried to force z3 to print only positive but the result was unsat so I tried to run the challenge with those result hopefully it will work and it does:

```zsh
âžœ  tmp git:(master) âœ— ./img.elf_patched -3 8 -7 -9
N0PS{r1CKUNr0111N6}
```

## Meaningful Noise

we get an image that looks like that 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mosheDO/mosheH4x0r/master/assets/2023-06-02/pxls.png)

I used this script to get a sense of what the image pixels are:

```py
from PIL import Image
import sys
im = Image.open(sys.argv[1])
bands = ''.join(im.getbands())
width, height = im.size
pre=''
for h in range(height):
	for w in range(width):
		pixels = im.getpixel((w,h))
		if bands=='RGBA':
			r,g,b,a = pixels
			print (r,g,b,a)
		elif bands=='RGB':
			r,g,b = pixels
			print (r,g,b)
		else:
			print (pixels)
	print
```

we got only `0` and `255`:

```
âžœ  Meaningful Noise âœ— python3 pixels.py pxls.png | sort | uniq
0
255
```

so I tried to change the 255 to 1 (IDK why; just tried)
and I put the input in CyberChef to try if we can extract something from that

and indeed it was:
